# Session Service Node Monitor and Email Alert Script

The service node [monitor script](monitor.py) is a simple script to easily monitor your Session Service Nodes. If your
service node's last accepted uptime proof becomes older than 66 minutes, the script will email you an alert. The script
is currently set to check your node's uptime proof age every five minutes.

## Session Open Service Node Finder

Open service node finder will be deprecated soon.

~~I recently built a [node finder script](node_finder.py) to help me find open nodes to contribute to when I have only a
small amount of Session to contribute. When you run the script it will ask you for the minimum and maximum you are looking
to contribute. The script will then scan the service nodes every five minutes looking for ones that aren't yet active
due to not having 15,000 Session contributed. If it finds a match, it will email you a notification containing all
matching nodes.~~

Please use these scripts at your own risk. I provide no guarantees of accuracy or functionality.


### To install and run:
 - Clone repo
 - CD into repo dir
 - Create virtual environment and activate it. ex. `python -m venv venv`
 - Install required modules: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Create ENV file from sample env file: `cp sample.env.txt .env`
 - Edit ENV file in your preferred text editor and save.
 - Test that you can send email alerts: `python yagmail-setup.py`
 - Create node_list file: `cp sample_node_list.py node_list.py`
   - Note: `node_list.py` is included in the .gitignore file so you can safely add your SNode PubKey(s) without worry of pushing them to a repo.
 - Add your Session Snode PubKey(s) to the `snode_list` in your `node_list.py` file. You can also add or change the remote nodes in the `remote_node_list`. The remote nodes included in the sample file should work out of the box.   
 - Run script in detached screen: `python monitor.py`

### Run Node Finder
 - After completing the install steps above, start a screen, activate the virtual environment, and run: `python node_finder.py`.
 - Input the minimum amount you are looking to stake.
 - Input the maximum amount that you can stake.
 - Detach screen and let it run.

### Run as a system service:
 - `cd /etc/systemd/system`
 - Create a new file with .service file extension and open it to edit. ex. `sudo vi snodemonit.service`
 - Paste the contents of the included sample-service-file.txt into the new file.
 - Update the ExecStart line to include the actual paths to your virtual environment Python and your monitor.py script.
   - Example virtual environment path: `/home/$USER/Session-snode-monitor/venv/bin/python`
   - Example path to monitor script: `/home/$USER/Session-snode-monitor/venv/monitor.py`
 - Save the file.
 - Run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to reload the systemd manager configuration.
 - To start the monitor service, run: `sudo systemctl start snodemonit.service` (This assumes you named your service file *snodemonit.service*)
 - To enable the monitor to start on system boot, run: `sudo systemctl enable snodemonit.service`


### Common systemctl commands:

*All of the following commands assume you named your service file: snodemonit.service*

To check the status of the service, run:

`sudo systemctl status snodemonit.service`

To start the service, run:

`sudo systemctl start snodemonit.service`

To stop the service, run:

`sudo systemctl stop snodemonit.service`

To restart the service, run:

`sudo systemctl restart snodemonit.service`

To disable service autostart on system boot, run: 

`sudo systemctl disable snodemonit.service`

If you make changes to your service monitor files (ex. the .env file), make sure to restart your monitor service file so that those changes are picked up.

If you make changes to the .service file in /etc/systemd/system, make sure to run the daemon-reload command to have your service file changes get picked up by systemd. Then restart the monitor service.

Lastly, to review the logs of your service node monitor when running as a system service, run:

`sudo journalctl --unit=snodemonit.service`
